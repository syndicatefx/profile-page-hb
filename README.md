#Profile-page-hb

A onepage personal profile boilerplate template to use with harpjs. Get instructions on how to install and use [harpjs](http://harpjs.com).

##Demo 

[profile-page-hb.surge.sh](http://profile-page-hb.surge.sh)

##Usage

Edit __harp.json__ to add __Contact__ and __Social Networks__, your __name__, __job title__, __site name__, __background image url__ and other important meta information. If you're using Google Analytics, you can activate it by changing "analytics" to *true* and adding your unique account ID. 

On the social network links, only the ones you provide an url for will be displayed. I've provided only 8 options here, but you can always add your own icons and other social networks by editing __public/_partials/aside.jade__

The same goes for *user_company* and *user_phone*, they will only show if you provide a value.

- - -
Edit the __public/index.md__ file to insert long form content about you or what ever you want, in markdown format, it will show up in this *slide-in* section.

- - -
Don't forget to replace the images in __public/img/__ with your own:
- avatar.jpg <small>*(keep same name + ext)*</small>
- favicon.ico
- apple-touch-icon.png
- og_image.gif
- bg.jpg <small>*(or what ever you entered in harp.json configuration)*</small>

- - -
If you want to change the design or edit the page's layout, you can always adventure into the __public/css__ and __public/_partials__ folders and explore.

- - -
Thats it, compile with harpjs and upload contents of generated __www/__ folder to your server.
